# rearray_tool

## Overview

A software tool that takes user text input of one to four 96 well microplate plate maps and rearrays them into a higher-throughput 384 well microplate plate map.

**Background** 

Transferring samples from 96 to 384 well plates requires plate maps for record keeping. At first glance generating these plate maps seems easy to quickly "automate" with Excel spreadsheets or loop. However to work with automation equipment, samples must be *stamped* from a 96 well plate into the 384 well plate a specific, standardized way. In the 384 well plate, 96 well plates 1 + 2 are stamped in every other well of every other column, alternating columns with 96 well plates 3 + 4.
